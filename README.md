OutInTheCold
============
<strong>OutInTheCold</strong, or <strong>OITC</strong>, is a new realism plugin for Minecraft Bukkit servers.

The simple objective of OutInTheCold is to add environmental- and temperature-based effects for players to survive.
Things such as temperature, light, shelter and weather can effect a player's health, hunger, thirst (see <a href="https://github.com/Ar7ific1al/Parched">Parched</a>), etc.


As this plugin develops, it will address such real=life complications as have been outlined above (hopefully).
